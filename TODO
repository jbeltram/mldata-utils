OCTAVE
======
- octave i/o currently works only for dense real valued things: support for cell arrays of strings is possible but parser needs to be adjusted like

# name: x
# type: cell
# rows: 1
# columns: 2
# name: <cell-element>
# type: sq_string
# elements: 1
# length: 3
foo

# name: <cell-element>
# type: sq_string
# elements: 1
# length: 4
bbal

same holds for sparse matrices which would easily work via

# name: z
# type: sparse matrix
# nnz: 2
# rows: 10
# columns: 10
1 2 2
7 2 1

MATLAB
======
- only works only for dense real valued things (scipy/s savemat does not support strings / sparse matrices) - won't be easy to fix - so mark as won'tfix for now

CSV
===
- should work for all types but won't work with strings containing "," - no escaping is done here

ARFF
